# Metasploitable2 Docker Lab
## Overview
This repository documents a cybersecurity lab that demonstrates the process of **reconnaissance and exploitation**. The lab environment was created using **Docker** to set up a secure, isolated network with a **Kali Linux** container as the attacking machine and a **Metasploitable2** container as the vulnerable target.

The primary objective was to identify and exploit common, well-known vulnerabilities to gain a comman shell on the target system.
***
## Lab Environment Setup
The lab was built using **Docker** and **Docker Compose on a Windows host machine. The 'docker-compose.yml' file defines the two containers and a private network to allow them to communicate.
